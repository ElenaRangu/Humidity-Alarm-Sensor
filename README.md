The Moisture Sensor Alarm System is a project designed to monitor the humidity levels in the environment and trigger alarms based on predefined thresholds. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including its components, functionality, implementation details, and simulated setup using Tinkercad.
Implemented in TinkerCAD, Program language: C++ 

Tinkercad Simulation Setup:

Arduino Board: The central component of the simulation, representing the microcontroller.
Moisture Sensor: Connected to one of the analog pins (A0) of the Arduino board for humidity measurement.
LED: Connected to a digital pin (D13) of the Arduino board to indicate the system's status.
Buzzer: Connected to a digital pin (D6) of the Arduino board to emit alarm sounds.
Push Button: Connected to a digital pin (D8) of the Arduino board to toggle the system ON/OFF.
LCD Display: Connected to the corresponding digital pins (D2-D7) of the Arduino board for visual feedback.
